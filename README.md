# JapaBookmarksDateViewer
 A simple C# tool built to View the Date of an Bookmarks Export.

## Why you should use this program
- This program will be used (even if once) if you are trying to figure out precisely when did you bookmark something
- Chromium Browsers (like Chrome and Brave; so far i've only tested in Chromium Browsers) save the Bookmark's date as a [UNIX Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) but for some reason the End-User wont be able to see it normally, if he does not have the knowledge to do so.
- This program as previously stated, will help you to find this pesky little UNIX Time and convert it to actual Date that you can read
- It is also Open-Source, so you can be 100% sure i wont be seeing your Homework folder ;)

## How to use
This program is easy to use as 1, 2, 3
- If in doubt of how you get export your Bookmarks as HTML, check [this page](https://www.wikihow.com/Export-Bookmarks-from-Chrome)
- Drag and drop the Exported HTML in the Program's executable
- The program will attempt to read the whole file, and then it will output what was read as output.txt
